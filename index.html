          In America, a cookie is described as a thin, sweet, small cake. By
          definition, a cookie can be a variety of hand-held, flour-based sweet
          cakes, either crisp or soft. Each country has its own word for
          “cookie”. In England and Australia they’re referred to as biscuits, in
          Spain they’re galletas. Germans call them keks and in Italy they have
          several names to identify the various forms of cookie. In America, the
          Dutch word “koekje” was Anglicized to “cookie”.
